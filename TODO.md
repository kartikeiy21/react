# TODO: Build React Routing for Three Components

- [ ] Create 'LibraryApp.jsx' in 'my-project/src/' by extracting and converting the React code from 'lapp.js'.
- [ ] Create 'InheritanceApp.jsx' in 'my-project/src/' by extracting and converting the React code from 'inheritence.html'.
- [ ] Rename 'App.jsx' to 'ProductApp.jsx' for clarity.
- [ ] Add 'react-router-dom' to 'my-project/package.json'.
- [ ] Run 'npm install' in 'my-project' to install react-router-dom.
- [ ] Update 'my-project/src/main.jsx' to wrap the app with BrowserRouter.
- [ ] Modify 'ProductApp.jsx' to set up Routes for /library (LibraryApp), /inheritance (InheritanceApp), and /products (ProductApp).
- [ ] Add navigation links in each component for routing.
- [ ] Test the app with 'npm run dev' to ensure routing works.
